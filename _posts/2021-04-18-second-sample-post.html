# SAMPLE FRONT MATTER
# Every post needs front matter. You
# can add anything you want - and then access it via liquid tags.

# Titles are not required by default
title: "Second post title"
subtitle: "Subtitle placeholder number 2"

# You are required to specify a layout
layout: default

<header>
  <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
  <h2>{{ page.subtitle }}</h2>
</header>

<p>
 No fluff here. An HTML5 doctype, some meta tags, and a body element waiting for you to fill it with content.
